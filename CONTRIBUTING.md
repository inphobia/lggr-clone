# How to contribute

Feel free to add your ideas, enhancements and bug fixes to this project.

## Create gitlab account

You can create your own account on this instance, but it has be be acknowledge by either me or the admin - which is me again :-) - to prevent spam and other DoS problems. So better write an additional email after initial registration to [me](info@lggr.io)

## Fork and merge

Just use the default git way to work with given projects, add a ticket to the main project or create merge requests.

## Legal stuff

I am no lawyer, but if you add code you might want to be named in some place in the documentation or code. Just add your wishes.
